# Portfolio

It is the first version my personal website build in React.js & designed using SCSS from scratch, without using any UI framework like Bootstrap or Material UI.

## Note
`ðŸ“¢ fork or copy the Repo to make it your own personal website and being a decent person, don't forget to give me proper credit of this hardwork.`

## Scripts to run

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

That's all folks!
